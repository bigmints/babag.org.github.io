Winter season in UAE is very different than the rest of the world. Winter her is all about going out, camping, being with nature etc. The 4-5 months of pleasant weather helps the residents to finally go out and enjoy the outdoors. Out of these, there is a large group of people who spends their weekend in the deserts, or wadis, or mountains camping. And I am one of them.

I have been camping during the winter seasons for atleast 10 years now. Like most, I also started as a wannabe and I feel confident to call myself an expert now.
